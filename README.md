# CSE-574

The objective of this project is to implement a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and
evaluate its performance in classifying handwritten digits. Feed forward propagation, Backward
propagation were used for implementation of the neural network. We have evaluated the
performance of the neural network by changing the values of hidden nodes, regularization
coefficients.
